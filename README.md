# Intruduction
  The fundamental method entails developing a calculator featuring conventional mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
  It is necessaryto devise a user interface (UI) comprising buttons for every digit and operation, alongside a display region for presenting the input and outcome. 
  JavaScript functions can be employed to execute button interactions and carry out the required computations, thereby implementing the calculatorâ€™s logic.

# Prerequisites
React Native State
React Native Props
React Event Handling
Javascript Operator
Expo CLI

# Steps to Create React Native Application
Step 1:   Create a react native application by using this command
           npx create-expo-app react_native_calculator

Step 2:  After creating your project folder, i.e. calculator-app-in-native, use the following command to navigate to it:
          cd calculator-app-in-native
          
Step 3: Open the App.js file. Simply write the source code into the App.js file in any editor(vs code).

step 4: To run the react native application, open the vs code Terminal and enter this command: 
         npx expo start
         
# To proceed with testing your Expo app using Expo Go, follow these steps:
#  Install Expo Go on your Mobile Device:
 1.  On Android, you can install Expo Go from the Google Play Store.
     On iOS, you can install Expo Go from the App Store.
     
 2.  Connect your Mobile Device to the Same Network:
           Ensure that your mobile device is connected to the same Wi-Fi network as your development machine.

3.Scan the QR Code:
      Open Expo Go on your mobile device.
      Use the camera app on iOS or Expo Go on Android to scan the QR code displayed in your terminal where the Metro Bundler is waiting.
      Wait for the App to Load: After scanning the QR code, Expo Go will load your app on your mobile device.
